smart-solar
===========

A remote condition monitoring system for battery charging stations in developing countries such as The Gambia.

Arduino
-------
Contains all code used to control a 2G SM5100B modem, and send and receive data to a remote server.

Java Server
-----------
Multi-threaded server used to receive data from remote system, parse and update SQL database, and send messages containg asset condition back to remote system.

Web Application
---------------
Includes: Javascript charts and tables to show data, PHP login/registration system, user enabling/disabling of assets.

Android
---------------
Application developed using PhoneGap to scan a battery's barcode, and then show data loaded from remote server.

Testing
---------------
Files used for prototyping, and testing certain features of entire system.


Development Environments
========================
Many development environments were used throughout the project, this section details their set up and configuration.

Java Development
----------------
Eclipse was used as the Java development IDE, this is available at http://www.eclipse.org/. 
In order to connect Java applications to an SQL database, the Java Database Connector was set up following the tutorial available at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/connecting.html.

Web Development
---------------
Within this project, Microsoft Expression Web 4 was used, as it was available through the university’s MSDNAA subscription.  Other development environments are available, such as Adobe Dreamweaver.  The website was coded from scratch, using the ‘split’ view to preview style changes.
As discussed in the report, XAMPP was used as the development server for the website.  It is also possible to forward port 80 through the router, so the website can be viewed externally.  XAMPP is available at http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html, and an installer is available for Windows machines. 

Arduino Development
-------------------
The Arduino IDE was used for this, available at: http://arduino.cc/, with the external Flash library required as discussed in the report. This library is available at: http://arduiniana.org/libraries/flash/, and can be installed by extracting the downloaded folder to the libraries folder in the Arduino installation directory.

Android Development
-------------------
Eclipse was used for the Android development, with the Mobile Developer Solutions AppLaud PhoneGap plugin.  Tutorials are available for the setup of the plugin at their website: http://www.mobiledevelopersolutions.com/.  Android SDKs must be downloaded and can be found here: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html.

Set up of demonstration
-----------------------
XAMPP should be started, and PHPMyAdmin (included in XAMPP) used to import the prepared database, smartsolar.sql.

The website files need to be copied to the ‘htdocs’ folder in the XAMPP installation directory, and can then be accessed in a web browser by going to the address http://localhost/smartSOLAR/, or by replacing the keyword localhost with the server’s IP address.  The website files are found in the web application folder on the CD.

The server’s public IP needs to be changed within the Arduino Mega code, near the top of the file MegaModemControl_v2_0.ino in the Arduino folder.  

In a similar fashion, the Android application’s server IP needs to be changed. This is done by importing the two projects found in the Android folder into Eclipse, as set up above.  The IP address needs to be changed in the file:
Android/barcodeScanner/assets/www/batteryInfo.html.
Use of a static IP address would negate the requirement for these alterations.

The string that is sent to the server can be generated by using the Java application found in Testing/Create Dummy String, and altering the dates required within the source code.  This generates random information in the correct format that can be parsed with the server.

The Java server can be run in the command line, providing the Java runtime environment is installed using the command:
	java –jar javaServer.jar
This runnable jar file is found in the Java Server folder
